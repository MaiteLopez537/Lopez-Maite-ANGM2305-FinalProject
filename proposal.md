## Description

I will create a galaxy video game where the setting takes in on space. The main ship was sent from earth on a journey to stop an alien mothership from invading earth. However, some obsticles that the main spaceship (player) will go through are meteorites/rocks. As the final boss, the spaceship will take on an alien spaceship, using a red laser shot, to defeat the enemy alien. 

## Features

- Feature 1: Core Gameplay Features: Player Controls, Scoring System, Win/Lose Conditions 

	- These features will allow us to control the spaceship and the laser shots with our keyboards and spacebar, along with gaining points whenever we destroy the rocks and the alien mothership. Additionally, allowing us to maintain the game logic, where we win: It would show: "You Won!" and when you lose, it will show: "You Died, Try Again." allowing us the option to restart the game.

- Feature 2: Game Elements: Health & Maybe Level Stages

	- Only two levels happening in the game: 

    The First Level: where rocks start coming out and need to hit 10

    Second Level: [Final Boss] Fight Alien Mothership. Where to win, we need to hit the ship with 20 laser shots 

    Health: The rocks coming will affect the main spaceship's health. BUT, these rocks will also be theelement that will help the player get to the next round: Final Boss. The Final Boss: The Alien mothership, will start shooting, and with that, player must avoid them, so that they won't die. It will take 15 shots to kill the player. 

- Feature N: Game Loop

	- Make sure the game is presentable and the game to work, if any debugs; fix it, so that the game can run again with a "Try Again" option, if we get to lose.

## Challenges

- One thing that I want to accomplish is that the player controlling the spaceship, when first entering the game, they will encounter meteorites/rocks. They will need to destroy 10 rocks, so that the alien mother ship will show up. Although my worry is creating that game loop to make that situation/level happen. 

- One worry when playing the game is that the alien mothership will then start shooting green lasers towards the main spaceship, so we need to avoid them, so that we won't die, but need to create a script for dying, so that the game won't debug when player dies. 

- Finally, creating a loop where the player can have the opportunity to start shooting the ship, so that the code can make the lasers have effect on the alien mothership, which will take 20 shots for the mothership to go down and win the game. Then make the game end with "You Won" and having the option to try again or just exit the pygame window. 

## Outcomes

Ideal Outcome:
- Briefly describe what is the ideal outcome?
The ideal outcome is to destroy the alien mother ship, without getting killed. If that is not the case, then given the possibility to retry again. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Briefly describe the bare essential for a good working outcome?
The bare essential is to destroy the rocks coming towards the ship, if necessary. The rocks will affect main spaceship health, but will be the key to fight the alien mothership, and from that, player must try to shoot the mothership 20 times to win. 


## Milestones

- Week 1

  1. Goal 1: Brainstorm ideas, and even sketch out some designs for my videogame

  2. Goal 2: Input some code and have my sketch finished to input the images on my script file, start having some game features in the script

- Week 2

  1. Goal 1: Input special design on the ship laser and also input the other ship's design, start writing some script down: Have the game functions/elements implemented. Along with having the background, the spaceship, and the rocks design/drawn

  2. Goal 2: Modify the alien's ship, so that it would start shooting green lasers towards the main spaceship. Also add a losing script varible, so that my pygame window leaves or the game quits

- Week N (Final)

  1. Goal 1: Add any special effect/finishing touches & edit the final script: if any debugs left

  2. Goal 2: Modify the script and make sure that the game is presentable, present the video, and turn in the assignment
