## Description
Summary: 

An adventure game where the setting takes in on space. It starts with the main ship (player) being sent from Earth on a journey to stop an alien mothership from invading Earth. However, some obstacles the main spaceship (player) will face are avoiding getting hit by meteorites/rocks. As the final boss, the spaceship will take on an alien spaceship, using a red laser shot, to defeat the enemy alien.

Project file description: 

Foremost, the first essential was to apply the game essentials and have the ship able to move with the basic controls, while using any computer. 

Additionally within my code, the video game contains some elements that help showcase the color's numbers along with some simple elements that many people would see on the video game. For instance, going back on the colors, I used the color's numbers as a template to make the code understand what I'm trying to say when I want to change the color to a different color. For example, I used colors to differentiate the laser shots, the asteroid's explosion effect, the color of our health bar (which are hearts), along the color of the alien mothership's health bar. 

Another element that I added in the code was for the player to move on to the next round script. I coded a length shot on how many shots the player needed to get to move on to the next round. In this case, it was a potential number between 10-20 rocks getting hit, or more or less, the score on the top left should indicate 'Score: 100' to move on to the boss fight (where it was also added to defeat the final level, with hitting the alien ship 10-20 times). However, the alien ship can defend itself back by shooting 3 laser shots at the same time. 

Another element that I used, which was mentioned before, was the laser shots to prevent the player from death as a weapon to defend itself from getting impacted by the rock's impacts and the alien's hits (both were also programmed to make the player get hurt in the process when it gets hit). 

Furthermore, I also imported some jpeg images on my src file, so that way I could import them into my game as a design for certain items. For instance, I have an image that is designed as my galaxy-space background, an alien design, and my spaceship as a final design. 

Some game elements that were designed were the works, the health bars, and the font style of 'score:', 'Try Again', 'You Died', and 'You Win'. These were designed carefully, along with choosing a color that could best fit the videogame. This was rather a struggle because I wanted to improve the font to make it look more pixel-like, but what was the best choice of font that fit the words was Times New Roman. Additionally, the heart and the rocks were designed within the script. It was rather difficult to get the proportions right, but what I was inspired by when designing the rocks was based on a rock called a carborundum rock. Although, I do need to admit that the design needs more improvement. However, I like the colors used for these rocks, since my goal was to make these rocks rather special, rather than having a basic brown, black, or gray rock. 

Another thing that was rather difficult to do was to produce explosive effects. It was rather difficult on what color to choose, and how would the effect look while playing the game, but I decided to keep the explosion effect rather bubbly and cute. Finally, something else that I want to point out is the difficulty of creating another game level since it was rather complex to add the spaceship while the rocks were falling. I was provided a little hand, however, what needed to improve was to make the last rocks fall, and then make the spaceship come in (which was quite difficult to produce in that scene).

Finally, the last element is the game loop in this game. This game has a beginning and a end, but we could restart the game, and get a second chance. When the player loses the game, the final print that is given is 'You Died, Try Again', so that it can get a second chance to come back. This essential is also provided when the player wins the game if he decides to play again or exit the game.
